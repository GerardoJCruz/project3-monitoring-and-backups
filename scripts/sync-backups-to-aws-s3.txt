1.- Create and attach an IAM role to the EC2 instance. 
This is to avoid storing AWS keys on the instances. The instance will get temporary credentials automatically. 

* In AWS Console -> IAM -> Roles -> select EC2 -> attach a custom policy that allows the instance to put/list/delete objects in your backup bucket (or the managed policy AmaazonS3FullAccess for testing only).
Attach the role to the running instance (Instance Settings -> Attach/Replace IAM role).



Minimal example policy (replace my-backup-bucket with the name of your S3 bucket you previously created):
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement":[
    {
      "Effect":"Allow",
      "Action":[
        "s3:PutObject",
        "s3:PutObjectAcl",
        "s3:ListBucket",
        "s3:GetBucketLocation",
        "s3:DeleteObject"
      ],
      "Resource":[
        "arn:aws:s3:::my-backup-bucket",
        "arn:aws:s3:::my-backup-bucket/*"
      ]
    }
  ]
}
